# Warp

In Einstein's theory of relativity, he states that lightspeed is the fastest possible speed in spacetime, but if space itself can travel faster than that, using these principles, it possible to bend space to travel faster than light. Alcubierre’s warp drive is a theoretical way to travel faster than light by bending space time—compressing it in front of a spaceship and expanding it behind. The ship stays in flat spacetime while space itself moves. It requires exotic negative energy, which is purely hypothetical and currently impossible to produce.
